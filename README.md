## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Katie and I'm a software engineer in Los Angeles, California.

- :star2: I currently work with Unity Game Engine and C# on a day to day basis, though I'm familiar with other languages as well (eg. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++) and have created small, web based applications in the past.
- :star2: Feel free to check out my [portfolio website](https://www.katiepustolski.com/) to see some of the projects I've worked on. It's mostly design focused and goes into detail about processes behind each project.
- :star2: The code examples below are intended to be simple and small (like Costco free samples), but big enough to show a level of skill.
