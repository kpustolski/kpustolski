## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Katie and I'm a software engineer in Los Angeles, California.

- :star2: I currently work with Unity Game Engine and C# on a day to day basis, though I'm familiar with other languages as well (eg. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++) and have created small, web based applications in the past.
